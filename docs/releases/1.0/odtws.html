    This is the first version of a draft for an Open Digital Twin Standard (ODTWS) created by the Technical
    Committee for the Open Digital Twin Standard which is currently constituted of the authors of the
    Open Digital Twin Platform (ODTP). The standard is meant to be inclusive and overarching technical
    implementations of digital twins across all potential applications in business, governance, and
    research. As such, we encourage each body interested in the subject to contact us to join the
    Technical Committee for following drafts and the eventual standard. We are also open to input from
    International organizations, governmental and non-governmental, to take part in the work.
  </p>
  <p>
    The procedures used to develop the first draft of this document and those intended for its further
    maintenance are described as follows:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      The documentation of the ODTP has been extracted.
    </li>
    <li>
      The text is generalized to describe a generic execution environment for digital twins.
    </li>
    <li>
      The ODTP is taken as the reference implementation of the ODTWS.
    </li>
    <li>
      The ODTWS may diverge from ODTP to accommodate other digital twin technologies and platforms.
    </li>
    <li>
      Mutual agreement on the text of the standard is sought from all members of the Technical
      Committee.
    </li>
    <li>
      New members of the Technical Committee are admitted by existing members in an agreed-upon
      manner.

    For an explanation of the voluntary nature of standards, we refer to the outline by the ISO:
    https://www.iso.org/foreword-supplementary-information.html. They do not include contractual, legal,
    or statutory requirements. Voluntary standards do not replace national laws, with whose standards
    users are understood to comply with and which take precedence.
  </p>
  <p>
    We follow the ISO guidelines for normative ISO deliverables to understand how to implement the
    standard:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      "shall" indicates a <strong>requirement</strong> which indicates objectively verifiable criteria to be fulfilled and
      from which no deviation is permitted if conformance with the document is to be claimed
    </li>
    <li>
      "should" indicates a <strong>recommendation</strong> which indicates a possible choice or course of action
      deemed to be particularly suitable without necessarily mentioning or excluding others
    </li>
    <li>
      "may" is used to indicate that something is permitted
    </li>
    <li>
      "can" is used to indicate that something is possible, for example, that an organization or individual
      is able to do something
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    In order to improve the quality of international standards, we follow the 6 principles introduced by the
    World Trade Organisation Technical Barrier to Trade Committee that clarify and strengthen the
    concept of international standards as far as applicable:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      transparency
    </li>
    <li>
      openness
    </li>
    <li>
      impartiality and consensus

    <li>
      relevance and effectiveness
    </li>
    <li>
      coherence
    </li>
    <li>
      development dimension
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    The ODTWS series defines a framework to support the creation of digital twins of observable processes
    in the real world (physical twins).
  </p>
  <p>
    A digital twin monitors the observable processes and assists with analyzing these processes. Digital
    twins allow to increase the visibility into complex processes and make their digital representation
    transparent.
  </p>
  <p>
    The digital twins supported by the ODTWS framework depend on the implementation of the reference
    framework (e.g., ODTP) and the available components (and their technology and software
    requirements). Different domain applications may require different data standards. As a framework,
    this document does not prescribe specific data formats and communication protocols but informs on
    architectures that should be supported across different implementations to attain high-level
    interoperability.

      rely on external solutions beyond the ODTWS to work but follow ODTWS to be integrated.

  </figure>
  <p>
    Figure 1 shows the theoretical framework for digital twins with five environments, based on previous
    work on digital twins. The ODTWS framework aims to provide a standard for these five environments.
    The environments are split into two groups. The first group manages how to orchestrate generic
    digital twins with the data and connection environment, and the second group provides individualized
    features for specific digital twins from preexisting independent components of three kinds matching
    the environments:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Physical environment: Data loading and preprocessing
    </li>
    <li>Analytical environment: Data analysis including machine learning
    </li>
    <li>Virtual environment: Data Visualization, Data Interaction, and Decision-Making
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Most digital twins vary in their features strongly depending on the area of application. Requirements
    of realtimeness differ with regard to data acquisition and data output. Sometimes, data acquisition
    varies from working only with historical data to the Internet of Things (IoT) real-time data acquisition
    and data output of simulation results may take days to compute compared to minutely updates of
    prediction models. Another issue that digital twin development often faces is that these twins are
    developed by a small group or a developer/researcher with a narrow focus on just one topic (e.g.,
    data visualization, data simulation, data analysis) without the expertise to build an interoperable
    digital twin.
  </p>
  <p>
    ODTWS facilitates combining these digital twins’ features so that a bigger goal can be achieved without
    forcing developers into an intense collaboration and without having to maintain a complex product.
    Complex management is taken on the orchestrator, and individual features are developed in the
    components with little overhead and full control of the development process. ODTWS also defines the
    properties of a marketplace of components named the component zoo to facilitate the exchange of
    digital twin components to attain interoperability.

  <h2>Scope</h2>
  <p>
    The ODTWS series contains the following four parts:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>ODTWS-1 Components</strong>: A recipe to turn a tool into reusable components and a metadata
      specification for these components.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>ODTWS-2 Workflow</strong>: A specification of how components are chained together to produce workflows
      in the shape of directed acyclic graphs.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>ODTWS-3 Orchestrator</strong>: A specification for an orchestrator that how to instantiate executions of
      workflows.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>ODTWS-4 Zoo</strong>: A registry called Zoo where components and workflows can be registered and
      discovered for reuse and reproducibility.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Terms, definitions and abbreviated terms</h2>
  <table class="def">
    <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>Digital Twin</th>
      <td><p>A digital twin is an abstract construct to represent a physical twin by capturing key characteristics of
        interest to describe and analyze observable processes to a sufficient degree for a dedicated task and
        then make a decision or potentially actuate on the physical twin based on the findings. Degrees of
        realism required by a task may vary and this definition tries to accommodate all variants of digital
        twins, including subsets such as Digital Shadows (raw data visualization) and Digital Models (no
        coupling to the physical twin). In some cases, digital twins are coupled to virtual twins in case the
        physical twin does not exist yet to explore its potential properties. A virtual twin provides data to a
        digital twin that behaves as if it came from a physical twin. ODTWS covers all these variations and
        henceforth will refer to them plainly as digital twins.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>    
    <tr>
      <th>Open Digital Twin Platform (ODTP)</th>
      <td><p>The reference implementation of the ODTWS: A tool designed to generate specific digital twins
        by integrating into a platform how to design, manage, run, and share digital twins. It offers an
        interface (CLI and GUI) for running and managing digital twins. It wraps different open-source
        technologies according to ODTWS to provide a high-level Application Programming Interface
        (API) for the final user. Finally, it implements a zoo as a repository of searchable components
        to (re-)create digital twins. The current version of reference implementation may not
        implement all features of the standard yet but aims to do so in the long-run. The reference
        implementation can be found here: [[ODTP-Organization]]</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Components (ODTWS Term)</th>
      <td><p>Components for a digital twin are used to instantiate tools for specific tasks by providing
        implementations of the three individualized environments (see Figure 1). Each component
        provides an extension to the available capabilities under ODTWS that implementations (such as
        ODTP) may use to perform specific tasks in the digital twin. These extensions are generated by
        the community for the community, and their specific capabilities are not part of ODTWS, but
        ODTWS describes the features a component must have to be interoperable. This includes that
        the input/output of a component is validated semantically and that they run within a ([[Docker]])
        container as an independent micro-service. Typically, they can be one of the following
        categories:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Dataloader component (implementing the physical environment of the digital twin)</li>
          <li>Analytical component (implementing the analytical environment of the digital twin)</li>
          <li>Visualization component (implementing the virtual environment of the digital twin)</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Core/core-optional modules (ODTWS Term)</th>
      <td><p>Modules for a digital twin are used to instantiate solutions for generic tasks with a digital twin
        by providing implementations for features in the two orchestrating environments (see <a href="#figure1">Figure
        1</a>). Each module is tightly integrated into the reference implementation (e.g., ODTP) and is
        developed together with the maintainer of the reference implementation and deployed as
        needed. These core modules <strong>shall</strong> include the programmes needed to run the ODTWS
        implementation and wrap the services used into a user interface. Core-optional modules are
        not mandatory to run an ODTWS implementation with the minimal features (e.g., running
        manually ODTWS components) but <strong>should</strong> be implemented to provide a more complete
        experience of the ODTWS standard.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>        
    <tr>
      <th>Services</th>
      <td><p>ODTWS follows a micro-services architecture to generate a digital twin. Each service refers to
        one logical unit that performs one specific task in an independent manner to produce a digital
        twin. In ODTWS, both modules and components are instantiated as (micro-)services. These are
        chained together to produce an effective implementation for a specific digital twin. The digital
        twin combines generic features for digital twins (modules) with individual solutions for a
        specific task (components).</p>
      </td>
    </tr>      
    <tr>
      <th>Semantic input & output validation</th>
      <td>
        <p>
          In the ODTWS abstraction Digital twin components can be considered data converters. The input
          to such a converter must be a file structured in a certain way. The tool inside the component
          converts this input into a different format, such as data needed for visualization, a different
          structure, an obfuscation of data or other types of processing to the data such as aggregation,
          simulation, interpolation, and extrapolation. As the functioning of a component is dependent
          on the data it receives, a structured mechanism of describing the input data requirements
          ensures proper functioning of a component. A well-described input schema can help a user
          assess whether their data set will comply with the requirements of the component. The
          semantic description includes information about the filenames, folder structure, (multi-lingual)
          labels and definitions of the columns, keys, or properties within such a file, and some
          information about the datatypes expected for each parameter. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Having the input requirements accurately and structurally described is important, but as components
          may require many files, with many parameters associated to each file, automated validation of a
          dataset becomes a requirement for ODTWS. The automation of validation of each file in the input
          dataset may be performed in two steps. First, all files are discovered that exist in the input dataset
          and their associated parameters which are present within each file. Second, an expectation is
          formulated about what data is needed. The Instance data is an RDF-compliant representation of the
          input files. This entails triples in an [[RDF-XML]] compliant file format, describing a given input folder, with
          metadata about which files exist in this folder, and which variables exist in each file. The Schema data
          ([[SHACL]] shapes) is an [[RDF-XML]] compliant definition against which Instance data is checked. In other
          words - this design allows a data owner to check whether their data (or the output of another
          component) is compatible with the input requirements of a component.
        </p>
      </td>
    </tr>       
    <tr>
      <th>Workflow</th>
      <td><p>A workflow describes a chain of components that are supposed to be executed to produce the
        functionality of a digital twin. Workflows can be sequential but should also support Directed
        Acyclic Graphs (DAG). This allows workflows to execute complex tasks for digital twins by
        splitting the data flow and joining them where necessary.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>     
    <tr>
      <th>Execution and Trace</th>
      <td><p>An Execution instantiates the components in a workflow into a set of micro-services that are
        run once and for which operational data and results are captured. Every step of an Execution is
        logged in a trace of the digital twin for reproducibility purposes. A Digital Twin can be
        configured so executions are performed recurrently on time providing basic support for
        real-time setup.</p>

  <h2>ODTWS-1 Components</h2>
  <p>
    ODTWS-1 Components are the centerpiece of ODTWS: An ODTWS-1 Component is a wrapper to an existing
    tool. This wrapper makes the tool usable in an <a href="#odtws-3-orchestrator">ODTWS-3 Orchestrator</a>. 
    The instantiation of an ODTWS-1
    Component is not independent of the orchestrator, as the transformation from tool to component
    depends on the ODTWS-3 Orchestrator’s own implementation. However, ODTWS-1 Components shall be
    usable by any compliant ODTWS-3 Orchestrator. ODTWS-1 Components can be arranged into 
    <a href="#odtws-2-workflow">ODTWS-2 Workflows</a> and can be discovered by sharing them in 
    an <a href="#odtws-4-zoo">ODTWS-4 Zoo</a>. An orchestrator can search
    ODTWS-4 Zoos to find ODTWS-1 components to assemble a digital twin according to a ODTWS-2 Workflow.
  </p>
  <p>  
    ODTWS-1 components consist of the following elements further explained in the sections below:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Tools</strong>: explains what is considered a tool in the context of ODTWS</li>
    <li><strong>Components</strong>: explains how a tool can be turned into an ODTWS-1 Component</li>
    <li><strong>Versioning</strong>: explains the versioning of both tool and component and how they are coupled</li>
    <li><strong>Metadata</strong>: explains the metadata that are expected for a ODTWS-1 Component</li>

      <h4>Metrics Metadata file</h4>
      <p>Metrics are special outputs of a tool to the ODTWS-3 Orchestrator data storage. Metrics shall be
        provided by the tool developer. They shall be used for control and comparison of multiple executions
        and digital twins on a high level. They shall implement in the component a function, a path or
        stream/socket from where to store the metric data in the step representation of the ODTWS-3
        Orchestrator. Metrics may have semantic descriptions.</p>

      <h4>Semantic Input & Output Schema</h4>
      <p>The component author should semantically describe the data inputs and outputs required for the tool
        in a RDF-compliant ([[RDF-XML]]) format. All required files and parameters should be accurately described with
        labels, definitions and restrictions to enable semantic reasoning about a component. The output of
        the component should also be described entirely to create a semantic black-box view on the

  <section id="odtws-1-components-versioning">
    <h3>Versioning</h3>
    <p>The versioning of the tool and component need to be independent from each other, since there may
      be various reasons that justify a new component version:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The ODTWS-3 client has changed</li>
      <li>Elements of the Component such as the Dockerfile or the App have changed</li>
      <li>The version of the tool that is used in the component has changed</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Since the Tool version is important, it shall be added in the metadata of the component, see
    [Metadata File]. We recommend adding an automatic check that ensures that the version of the tool
    mentioned in the odtws.yaml file and the version that is actually used in the component match.</p>

      <h4>Ephemeral Components</h4>
      <p>Ephemeral components shall be temporary and shall not persist data (e.g. transforming data from
        one format into another). They shall be used for short-lived analytical operations and discarded after
        use. They shall be built when preparing the digital twin execution and shall only be used in a single
        execution step. Parameters shall be provided as environment variables, and input data shall be placed
        in one specific directory.

      <h4>Interactive Components</h4>
      <p>Interactive components shall be designed to interact with the user. These components should be
        used in user interfaces or visualizations. They shall be built in a certain execution step but will keep
        running as a ([[Docker]]) container until the user stops them. They are often the last step in an execution. 
        In real time settings, interactive components may expose parameters of other components forwarded
        by the orchestrator. Changing those parameters may trigger another execution of all components
        impacted by the change.

    <section id="odtws-1-components-type-api">
      <h4>Api Components</h4>
      <p>API components shall be built only once and can be reused in multiple executions. We can think of
        them as continuously running Microservices. The component is going to provide an API-Endpoint in
        one port that will allow running the tool in parallel or in multiple executions. This kind of component
        is useful when the component building process (in [[Docker]]) takes a large amount of time, or when a
        long-lasting task can be reused in multiple executions. An example of this is the loading of a machine
        learning model into memory.</p>
      <p>
        The API component receives the variables as JSON in the request’s payload. This allows a more
        complex configuration of parameters than in the Ephemeral type. Input data can be provided in the
        request, or, if the file size is big, as an item in the S3 storage ([[S3-Minio]]).

      exchange of data between consecutive components. In [[ODTP]] an S3 Data storage (([[S3-Minio]])) is used for that
      purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stored data can be used for partial executions of workflows, e.g. starting with the second
      component in a sequence but reusing the data loader component. This enables the user of the
      ODTWS-3 Orchestrator to reuse the output of computationally heavy components.

      (recursively analyze the files in a folder, and extract some metadata about the columns/properties of
      each file) and write it to an [[RDF-XML]] graph. This “instance data” (metadata about the input dataset) shall
      be validated against the “Schema data” provided by an ODTWS-1 Component. This shall be implemented using SHACL. 
      The ODTWS-3 Orchestrator shall run a ([[SHACL]]) validation engine on this
      combination to generate a report that provides information about the conformance of the dataset
      with the schema.

    <p>ODTWS-3 Orchestrators should warn users of non-conforming component connections. ODTWS-3
      Orchestrators may deny the execution of a workflow that does not conform to ODTWS-2 Workflows.
      The mode for a warning is called “Lazy execution”, where a workflow may run until an error occurs.
      The mode for strict conformance is “Safe execution”, where a workflow is not run if non-conforming.

  <h2>ODTWS-4 Zoo</h2>
    <p>An ODTWS-3 Orchestrator should be able to discover ODTWS-1 components proposed for an ODTWS-2
    Workflow in a registry called an ODTWS-4 Zoo. An ODTWS-4 Zoo is coupled to one or more ODTWS
    orchestrators and shall ensure that the ODTWS-1 components and ODTWS-2 Workflows that it registers
    are interoperable in the context of these ODTWS-3 Orchestrators. The zoo consists of the following
    parts:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Repository</strong>: A repository that contains the component /workflow registry and makes them
    available via an index</li>
    <li><strong>Registration Method</strong>: A recipe on how to register and unregister components / workflows from the
    zoo.</li>
    <li><strong>Metadata Specification</strong>: This specifies the metadata that are expected for the registration of a

<section class="appendix" id="ODTP">
  <h2>ODTP</h2>
  <p>The reference implementation of the ODTWS: A tool designed to generate specific digital twins by
    integrating into a platform how to manage, run, and design digital twins. It offers an interface (CLI,
    and GUI) for running and managing digital twins. It wraps different open source technologies
    according to ODTWS to provide a high level Application Programming Interface (API) for the final user.
    The reference implementation may not implement all features of the standard but aims to do so in the
    long-run. The reference implementation can be found here: [[ODTP]]. As
    such, ODTP is a Proof-Of-Concept of the ODTWS with the focus on specific digital twins in mobility
    context. It was built in order to establish the ODTWS Standard via a POC in collaboration between
    [[CSFM]] and [[SDSC]].
  </p>
  <p>
    In the following section we list the alignments and differences between ODTWS and ODTP: therefore
    this sections structure aligns to ODTWS:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>ODTP Components</strong>: ODTP components are very aligned to ODTWS-1 Components.</li>
    <li><strong>ODTP Workflows</strong>: the concepts of ODTWS-2 Workflows have not been implemented in ODTP yet.</li>
    <li><strong>ODTP Orchestrator</strong>: The ODTP orchestrator is aligned to the ODTWS orchestrator except that it
      does not support X.</li>
    <li><strong>ODTP Zoo</strong>: the zoo has been planned but not yet been implemented and is also not connected
      to the Orchestrator yet.</li>
  </ul>
  <section id="odtp-components">
    <h3>ODTP Components</h3>
    <p>ODTP Components served as role models for the concept of ODTWS-1 Components. In this section the
      implementation of ODTWS by ODTP comes very close. The <a href="#odtws-1-components-versioning">versioning</a> 
      as described in ODTWS has not yet been implemented. Also the <a href="#odtws-1-components-type-api">API Components</a> 
      are not yet supported. But both topics are on the
      roadmap and will be available in releases that have already been planned.</p>
    <p>See here for an example components in the context of ODTP:
      [[Odtp-Component-Example]]</p>
  </section>    
  <section id="odtp-workflows">
    <h3>ODTP Workflows</h3>
    <p>
      The concepts of ODTWS-2 Workflows and Workflow Templates have not been implemented in ODTP.
      But the need for them has surfaced through the user experience with the ODTP orchestrator:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Executions of workflows are often very similar, so that it makes sense to add templates for
      them, so that they can be created with more ease.</li>
      <li>he Combination of Components into Workflows is not arbitrary, but mostly components have
      been built for certain use cases that can be translated into workflows of components.
      Therefore it makes sense to register those established workflows once they have been tested
      and proven to work.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Therefore ODTP Workflows are on the roadmap of ODTP and will be implemented in an upcoming
      release.</p>      
  </section>  
  <section id="odtp-orchestrator">
    <h3>ODTP Orchestrator</h3>
    <p>
      The ODTP Orchestrator aligns to the ODTWS-3 Orchestrator and implements an orchestrator for the
      ODTP Components. It offers a command line interface and graphical user interface. It is still a POC
      so even some mandatory features of ODTWS have not been yet implemented there. ODTP was also
      used to evaluate beyond what itself currently offers the demands and needs for the digital twin
      orchestration. It thus directly enabled the formulation of the ODTWS.

    <section id="odtp-orchestrator-features">
      <h4>Features</h4>
      <p> 
        The features that have been implemented from ODTWS-3 Orchestrator are the following:

      <ul>
        <li><strong>User Interface</strong>: both GUI and CLI are available as interfaces</li>
        <li><strong>Usage of [[Docker]]</strong>: the usage of Docker is exactly as described in ODTWS-3 Orchestrator</li>
        <li><strong>Data Storage</strong>: has been implemented as described in ODTWS-3 Orchestrator</li>
        <li><strong>Operational Data: operational data for workflows and workflow templates have not yet been
            added, also the results in ODTP are not yet adjusted to results in ODTWS-3, that span over
            several executions. But the need for this has been identified and it will be implemented in
            ODTP the way it has been suggested in ODTWS-3</li>
        <li><strong>Tool Adapter</strong>: implemented as suggested in ODTWS-3 by proving a component template with
        instructions: [[Odtp-Component-Template]]</li>
        <li><strong>Client Library</strong>: implemented as in ODTWS-3 by providing a github repo that can be mounted via
        [[Git]] submodules in on the components, see:
        [[Odtp-Component-Client]] and
        [[Odtp-Component-Example]]</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Features on the roadmap are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Authentication</strong>: planned with [[Keycloak]] as suggested in ODTWS-3</li>

<section class="appendix" id="Mobility Causal Interventions">
  <h2>Mobility Causal Interventions</h2>
  <p>We provide another workflow for a digital twin that implements the mobility causal intervention
    framework to evaluate the robustness of deep learning models towards data distribution shifts, with
    the application of individual next location prediction (Hong et al, 2023):

  </figure>    
  <p>
    The mobility simulation module is used to generate individual location sequences. It also
    incorporates the causal intervention mechanism to generate intervened synthetic data that represent
    different data distribution shifts. These synthetic data are fed into the next-location-prediction module
    to quantify a model’s robustness against interventions. Meanwhile, a mobility-metrics module is used
    to monitor the change in the characteristics of mobility data.

  <p>
    Overview of the components:
  </p>
  <ul>
  <li>[[ODTP-SQL-Dataloader]]: This component performs SQL queries to a compatible database and
    create a dataframe output in csv format.
  </li>
  <li>[[ODTP-Postgis-Dataloader]]: This module performs postGIS SQL queries to postgresql databases
    containing and provides the output in csv format.</li>
  <li>[[ODTP-Mobility-Simulation]]: This module generates synthetic individual location visit sequences
    based on mechanistic mobility simulators (including EPR, IPT, Density-EPR, and DT-EPR
    models). The module also generates intervened synthetic mobility data based on causal
    interventions through the specification of parameters to be intervened and levels of the
    interventions.</li>
  <li>[[ODTP-Mobility-Metrics]]: This module includes multiple metrics to quantify the characteristics of
    individual mobility sequences, e.g., location visitation frequency, radius of gyration, real
    entropy, mobility motifs etc.</li>
  <li>[[ODTP-Next-Location-Prediction]]: This module includes two deep learning models for individual
    next location prediction, the LSTM model and the Multi-Head Self-Attentional (MHSA) model.</li>
