# ODTWS - Open Digital Twin Workflow Standard

This repo contains the Specification of the Open Digital Twin Workflow Standard

## About

The Standard was originally written as a Worddocument. The PDF of that document is included 
in the repo: the name of the standard then was ODTS (Open Digital Twin Standard). The name was 
changed to the current name after receiving feedback from the community that the feature to
build workflows from component was distinguishing this approach from other Digital Twin Specifications.

specification, it might be related to a downtime of the W3C Server:
Please check here: https://www.isitdownrightnow.com/w3.org.html and see whether the W3C Server is up,
